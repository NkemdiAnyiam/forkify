# forkify

Recipe application with custom recipe uploads.

I created the functionality for this website during Jonas Schmedtmann's The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert! course, though I have made some minor modifications, such as allowing the Add Recipe menu to refresh itself after an attempted submission.
The .htmlnanorc file here ensures that the Parcel build runs properly (otherwise, due to some bug with Parcel version 2.0.0-beta.1, parcel build just doesn't work due to some issue with the SVGs).

View the site here: https://forkify-nkemdi.netlify.app/ (I disabled the ability to upload recipes on this version).
